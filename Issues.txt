- All methods with email input accept any value instead of validating the correct email format
- Login with unexistent user returns success message with empty token instead of an error message
- Most API errors are Server side exceptions that don't actually mean much to the user, there should be clearer messages
- No validation on new Employees data, duplicate entries are accepted
- Employees DELETE method documentation is incorrect as it specifies parameter 'id' which is not accepted by the server, the accepted parameter name is 'ids'
- Employees PATCH method doesn't apply the data changes even though an 'updated' message is received
